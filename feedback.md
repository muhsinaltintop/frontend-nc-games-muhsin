comment and review voter components can be united in one reusable component - check the nc notes for hints on this
your comments component is redundant - the data fetching and mapping happens in comment card component instead
i added a console log to review card, comment card and comment voter literally saying "in <component" and when i vote see the screenshot below for how many comments we get - this is how many times state is being set with setVoted and how many times data is being fetched - this is what gives us the appearance that the page refreshes, its just 11 rerenders on components. when we vote we want only the voter component to rerender. i suspect this is from the setCommentVoted being passed around through multiple levels, and im not sure what the purpose of it is. again, have a look at the notes on optimistic rendering, should have some hints on what we would  like to see happen there. keep in mind that when a parent component rerenders, so do the children. so when you setState in the parent you rerended all the children too.
you have so many errors in console for receiving NaN for a value or not providing a key prop on mapped children. please tidy these off one by one, and do not let them pile up again - it is quite intimidating when you have many of these and they can obscure other errors which might be happening
